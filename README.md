# TravellingAntColonySalesman

This is a school project for my Object Oriented Programming course. The program attempts to find the optimal route for a user submitted text file. It utilizes Ant Colony Simulation in doing so. 

Features
  -Reads .txt files. The format is "name x y" and each city is on it's own line\n
  -Reliably good at solving TSPs that have less than 100 cities. Variance between results and total time of the simulation increases heavily after that.\n
  -Window for setting parameters\n
  -Window that draws the shortest route found\n
